# CSCI-260-Assignments
Assignments from my 260 Computer Architecture class (Fall 2020)

Project 1 is a MIPS Assembly Program that uses the MIPS simulator (MARS) to draw three shapes on a 2d bitmap display.
The input is the assembly language of the following C structure
struct projInput {
  unsigned int n,m;       // size parameters
  unsigned c1r, c1g, c1b; // red-green-blue for color 1
  unsigned c2r, c2g, c2b; // ... color 2
  unsigned c3r, c3g, c3b; // ... color 3
